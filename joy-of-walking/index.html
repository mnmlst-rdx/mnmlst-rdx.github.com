			<h2><a href="/">mnmlist</a>: <b>the joy of walking</b></h2>

			<div class="entry">

	
				<p>Today I set out from my house and walked. And walked.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t have a specific destination in mind, but wanted to walk a bit before finding a quiet place to write. So I walked, out of the town where I live and along the tropical, white-sand coastline, to the next town over.</p>

<p>As others drove cocooned in their cars, I walked, and emitted nothing but my breath.</p>

<p>As others spent their lunch hour pounding down fat-laden burgers and greasy fries or some other cheesy fried piled-high dish, I walked, and burned calories.</p>

<p>As others rushed and stressed, I walked, and took my time.</p>

<p>As others sat at their computers, I walked, and got my blood flowing.</p>

<p>As others held power business meetings and made deals, I walked, and had time to think.</p>

<p>As others were productive and got tasks done, I walked and got nothing done, and cleared my head.</p>

<p>As others had the comfort of shelter and air-conditioning, I walked and worked up a light sweat and was buffeted by the wind.</p>

<p>As a white gull floated serenely above a calm bay, I walked, and watched, and loved it.</p>

<p>I walked for an hour, then wrote and read, and then walked for another hour to get back home, tired but happy.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t walk this much every day, but I walk as much as I can, because you need nothing to walk, you spend nothing, you consume nothing, you emit nothing.</p>

<p>And yet you have everything.</p>

				<p>Now that I&#8217;ve learned to look at things with the lens of simplicity, I can see others making mistakes I&#8217;ve made in the past.</p>

<p>I want to gently say to them &#8212; and to my past self &#8212; &#8220;Stop making things so complicated!&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to criticize how other people do things in this post, but rather talk about things I did wrong in the past.</p>

<p>The biggest problem came when starting a new endeavor &#8212; starting running, trying to get organized or productive, starting blogging, getting out of debt, even the act of simplifying.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d always make things so complicated &#8212; looking back on it, I either want to cringe or laugh. And yet, I know that life is a learning process, and those early mistakes helped me to get to where I am. Even now, I make tons of mistakes, learning as I go.<span id="more-601"></span></p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong>: I wanted to be more productive, so I learned <span class="caps">GTD </span>(Getting Things Done, an excellent book by David Allen). I bought tools that other <span class="caps">GTD</span>ers recommended, set up a series of lists, tried out a couple dozen different software (and paper) approaches to lists. Every <span class="caps">GTD</span>er knows this problem. <span class="caps">GTD, </span>and many other productivity systems, can end up being complicated.</p>

<p>Today, my advice to my former self is: stop making it complicated. Productivity, such as I care about it today, is simple. You pick the most important thing you want to do today, clear distractions, and start on it. You don&#8217;t even need a list, though having a list for remembering what else needs to be done later is fine. Have one list, but don&#8217;t fiddle with it. Just pick one thing, and start working.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong>: When I wanted to get out of debt, I tried various financial software, I made spreadsheets, I made schedules for payments, I tracked everything, and so on. It was complicated, believe me.</p>

<p>Now I know it&#8217;s simple. First, stop the unnecessary spending (I know, easier said than done, but once you learn to recognize it and stop your impulse urges, it&#8217;s not complicated). Second, put everything you can to one debt at a time (first creating an emergency fund of at least $500), pay off that one debt, then pay off the next.</p>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong>: When I started blogging in January 2007, I looked at dozens of different blogging platforms/software, themes, ad platforms, ebooks, articles on every possible blogging topic. This is natural, as I was just learning the field.</p>

<p>But today, I know it&#8217;s simple: you pick a topic, and write. Then hit publish. Share your stuff via Twitter or Facebook if you like, but don&#8217;t worry so much about that. Just write interesting and/or useful stuff, and people will find you eventually. Just write, and publish.</p>

<p>When you start something new, sure, there&#8217;s a learning process. But also realize that while the learning is good, the doing doesn&#8217;t have to be complicated at all. Find the simplest way to do things, and just start doing it. You&#8217;ll learn by doing. </p>

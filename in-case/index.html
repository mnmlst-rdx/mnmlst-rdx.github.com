				<p>At the moment I&#8217;m on a plane to Guam with my family. I brought a small backpack with my laptop and a couple changes of clothes, for a month-long trip.</p>

<p>Packing light isn&#8217;t hard, until you run against the &#8220;Just In Case&#8221; Syndrome. Actually, having minimal possessions in your life isn&#8217;t hard, until you face this syndrome.</p>

<p>You already know what the &#8220;Just In Case&#8221; Syndrome is, without me having to describe it. You keep things (in your bag, or in your home or office) not because you actually need it, but just in case.</p>

<p>But when we look at this with actual evidence, we see that &#8220;just in case&#8221; means we keep a lot of stuff we don&#8217;t actually use. Try an experiment: monitor the &#8220;just in case&#8221; stuff you pack on a trip, or keep in your home. Make a list of the stuff you keep for &#8220;just in case&#8221; &#8212; stuff you haven&#8217;t used in the last few months but are worried you might need it.</p>

<p>Then see how many times in next 6-9 months you actually use that stuff.</p>

<p>I went on a trip to London &amp; Paris recently and packed fairly light &#8230; but even then it turned out I packed stuff I didn&#8217;t need. I took running shoes and workout clothes that I barely used, because I was so tired from walking all day (and I could do bodyweight exercises in my apartment). I had an extra pair of pants and an extra shirt I didn&#8217;t need. I really didn&#8217;t need any guide books.</p>

<p>I made a list of the things I really used, and the things I didn&#8217;t. For my next trip (a weekend in Portland), I only took the things I really used in London &amp; Paris. It was a small backpack, and it turned out to be perfect. I&#8217;m doing the same for Guam, though the trip is much longer and I&#8217;m much more likely to be swimming.</p>

<p>I have two pairs of shorts, a pair of jeans, three T-shirts, deodorant, two pairs of socks, two pairs of quick-drying boxers. That&#8217;s all I think I&#8217;ll need. If it turns out I need more, I can buy it, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll need it.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll see. And that&#8217;s the key: don&#8217;t just worry you might need it &#8230; find out.</p>

				<p>While visiting relatives in Las Vegas, I decided to get away from the overly conspicuous consumerism with an early morning run into the desert mountains.</p>

<p>Amidst the rocks I found a small cardboard sign with some neat handwriting on it:</p>

<p>&#8220;February 11 marks our 3,068th day living out here. Thanks P+T (for 3 weeks ago).&#8221;</p>

<p>Then there were numbers crossed out, marking the days after that, until it hit today&#8217;s total of 3,150. It also had a note inserted among the numbers that said &#8220;Happy Easter&#8221;.</p>

<p>It occurred to me that this hand-made sign is the most minimal blog there is. Basically a statement of how long they&#8217;ve been living out in the desert, and daily updates in the form of crossed-out numbers. With a shout out to friends, of course.</p>

<p>What is blogging at its best? This sign distilled blogging to its essence: regular updates that inspire others from someone doing something remarkable.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re thinking of (or are already) blogging, don&#8217;t be intimidated. All you need is to do something remarkable, and let people know about it. All you need is a marker and a publicly-posted piece of cardboard, really.</p>

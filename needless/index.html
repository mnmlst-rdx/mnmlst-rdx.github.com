				<p>The more I focus on living, the less it seems I need.</p>

<p>What does it mean to focus on living? It&#8217;s a shift from caring about possessions and status and goals and beautiful <strong>things</strong> &#8230; to caring about actual life. Life includes: taking long walks, creating things, having conversations with friends, snuggling with my wife, playing with my kids, eating simple food, going outside and getting active.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s living. Not shopping, or watching <span class="caps">TV, </span>or eating loads of greasy and sweet food not for sustenance but pleasure, or being on the Internet, or ordering things online, or trying to get popular. Those things aren&#8217;t living &#8211; they&#8217;re consumerist pastimes that tend to get us caught up in overconsumption and mindlessness.</p>

<p>When I focus on living, all those other fake needs become less important. Why do I need television when I can go outside and explore, or get active, or take a walk with a friend? Why do I need to shop when I already have everything I need &#8211; I can spend time with someone or create, and I need very little to do that.</p>

<p>These things I do now &#8212; they require almost nothing. I can live, and need little.</p>

<p>And needing little but getting lots of satisfaction &#8230; that&#8217;s immensely rewarding. It&#8217;s an economy of resources that I&#8217;ve never experienced before.</p>

<p>These days, I need nothing but my loved ones, a text editor, a way to post what I create, a good book, simple plant-based food, a few clothes for warmth, and the outdoors.</p>

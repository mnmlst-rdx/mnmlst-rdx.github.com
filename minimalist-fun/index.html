			<div class="entry">

	
				<p>On Twitter yesterday, <a href="http://twitter.com/SirDX">Brandon</a> asked:</p>

<blockquote><p>As a minimalist, what do you do for fun? That&#8217;s the only trouble I foresee should I decide to embrace the minimalist ideal.</p></blockquote>

<p>This brings up a common myth about minimalism &#8212; that we have empty lives, and can&#8217;t do anything fun because we try to eschew consumerism and all the spending that entails.</p>

<h3>The purpose of entertainment</h3>

<p>A brief discussion first: what is entertainment, and why do we need it?</p>

<p>Entertainment is usually meant to distract, to make us feel that our lives are exciting &#8212; distractions such as <span class="caps">TV, </span>movies, carnivals, going shopping, playing video games, drinking and partying. And while these each have other merits (a good film is a work of art), often they serve to distract us from work or other difficulties.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this fun is only temporary, and often empty. And as soon as we&#8217;re off that temporary high, we must find a new high from entertainment, ad nauseum.<span id="more-606"></span></p>

<p>I believe if you find contentment, you don&#8217;t need entertainment. That&#8217;s not to say you&#8217;d never watch TV or good films or go to parties or theme parks &#8230; but you wouldn&#8217;t need them for entertainment. You wouldn&#8217;t go shopping to fill an empty space in your life, to fill the need of finding happiness, because you&#8217;re already content and don&#8217;t have that empty space or need.</p>

<p>Finding contentment is learning to appreciate what you already have, learning the concept of having enough, learning to enjoy the simple things. It isn&#8217;t an overnight thing, but as you become more conscious of it, you&#8217;ll find more contentment and need to be entertained less.</p>

<h3>Minimalist fun</h3>

<p>So the question remains: what do I do for fun?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve made space for what&#8217;s most important to me, by eliminating the unnecessary. That&#8217;s what minimalism is really about, at its core, not emptying your life.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s important to me: family, writing, reading, running. And so my fun is finding time for those four things.</p>

<p>Some examples of things I&#8217;ve done in the last week for fun:</p>


<ul>
<li>Had a small family get-together for my daughter&#8217;s birthday</li>
<li>Went on a walking date with my wife, eating near the beach and walking to get coffee &amp; watch a movie</li>
<li>Ran three days a week with my sister</li>
<li>Worked out with my nephew, doing full-body weight exercises</li>
<li>Read with my kids</li>
<li>Took short walks with my daughter</li>
<li>Read a novel, magazine, online articles</li>
<li>Had lunch with my mom &amp; sister</li>
<li>Helped my mom in her garden</li>
<li>Wrote blog posts and some of my <a href="http://focusmanifesto.com">new book</a></li>
<li>Rode my bike to meet a friend for coffee</li>
</ul>



<p>Those are just a few examples, but you get the idea. They&#8217;re not everyone&#8217;s idea of fun, but I enjoy them.</p>

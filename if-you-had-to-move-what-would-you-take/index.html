<p>One of the most satisfying things happens when I move to a new house: forced minimalism.</p>

<p>When I move &#8212; and many people are the same way &#8212; I declutter my possessions so I don&#8217;t have to move so much. I&#8217;d rather get rid of half my stuff than have to pack and move it all.</p>

<p>It takes some work to declutter everything, but it&#8217;s deeply satisfying. And it&#8217;s much easier these days, now that I normally keep things fairly simple. Still, there&#8217;s always an accumulation of clutter that happens over time.</p>

<p>When I&#8217;m done moving, I&#8217;m down to the bare essentials (plus a few other comforts). My new home is beautifully minimalist, and I&#8217;m truly happy.</p>

<p>I try to keep my home like this most of the time, but with all my kids, it&#8217;s not always possible.</p>

<p>Moving forces me to be minimalist, and it&#8217;s a time of reflection: what do I need? What do I really use? What do I love?</p>

<p>So my question today for you: if you had to move today, what would you take?</p>

<p>It might be useful to make an actual list. Then it might be useful to get rid of everything not on the list.</p>

<p>Just a thought.</p>

<p><em>Note: you <a href="http://mnmlist.com/about/#comment">can&#8217;t respond to this question via comments</a>, but I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts on Twitter or on your own blog.</em></p>

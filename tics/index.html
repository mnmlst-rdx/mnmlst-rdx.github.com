			<div class="entry">

	
				<p>As minimalism seems to slowly grow in popularity, the more popular trend is criticizing minimalism.</p>

<p>Nearly everyone who doesn&#8217;t consider himself a minimalist has some criticism. Much of that is simply because it&#8217;s a trend, and people tend to attack anything trendy. But I think a bigger reason is that people feel threatened when they feel their lifestyle is criticized &#8212; and at its core, that&#8217;s what minimalism is. A criticism of the (modern) American way of life.</p>

<p>Minimalism isn&#8217;t about being cool or hip (though some might think so). It&#8217;s about re-examining our lives. It&#8217;s bucking against the trend of overconsumption, of consumption as the fundamental act of our lives. It&#8217;s a critique of the status quo of owning too much, of mindless buying of gadgets and big cars and clothes and other luxury items.</p>

<p>That critique is threatening to many people, and minimalism&#8217;s critics are often justifying their way of life. Take just one of many criticisms (there are too many to name): &#8220;I&#8217;m not a minimalist, I&#8217;m an appropriatist&#8221;. Or something like that (I haven&#8217;t seen the original quote). Sounds good, but if minimalism is asking &#8220;is this really necessary?&#8221;, then what does an appropriatist ask? &#8220;Is this appropriate?&#8221; Well, anyone can say anything is appropriate &#8212; my <span class="caps">BMW </span>is appropriate for my life, right? Basically, an appropriatist can also be called a &#8220;status quoist&#8221;.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s just one of many examples. It often feels like when I tell people I&#8217;m a vegan &#8212; they immediately get defensive about why they eat meat. I think that&#8217;s a good thing &#8212; at least they&#8217;re thinking about it, often for the first time.</p>

<p>Honestly, I have nothing against criticisms of minimalist &#8212; in fact I welcome them. Every time I see a criticism, I smile. Minimalism for me isn&#8217;t showing off, but simply starting a (long overdue) discussion. And it&#8217;s worked: people are talking about these issues, arguing both sides, and that is great. I&#8217;m simply asking the critics to consider whether they&#8217;re just being defensive, or if they&#8217;re arguing from an honest place with rational objections.</p>

				<blockquote><p>&#8220;The secret of happiness, you see, is not found in seeking more, but in developing the capacity to enjoy less.&#8221; <strong>- Socrates</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>In that one little line, Socrates summed up one of the major problems with our modern society, and offered a simple solution.</p>

<p>Pretty brilliant, I&#8217;d say.</p>

<p>In fact, he negated the need for me to write more, but stubborn as I am, I will proceed. I&#8217;d like to talk about this capacity to enjoy less.</p>

<p>Is it difficult to enjoy less? No, not really, but it takes a change in mindset, which as with many such changes takes time and adaptation.</p>

<p>If you enjoy chocolate ice cream, as I do, when confronted with a tub of it would you also enjoy eating as much of the tub as possible? I know that&#8217;s what many of us do when faced with delicious food.</p>

<p>But what if you learned to enjoy just a few bites of the ice cream? And with each bite, savor the flavor, the coldness, the creaminess, the chocolatiness. (Yes, that&#8217;s a word, spell-checker &#8211; I made it up.)</p>

<p>If you love clothes, instead of buying more and more each weekend, can you learn to cull your wardrobe into a few quality, beautiful pieces that you can wear often, and enjoy more?</p>

<p>The same applies with anything we love &#8230; including online reading and communicating (email, Twitter, Facebook, forums). We often seem obsessed with more of it. But instead, consider reading just the quality stuff, and if a blog or Twitter feed doesn&#8217;t deliver quality consistently, consider dropping it.</p>

<p>Learn to love less television, movies, chatter, spending, shopping, eating out, junk food, technology, consumption, productivity. You get the idea.</p>

<p>When you focus on enjoying less, you focus on full enjoyment. You learn to be content with little, and when you do that, a life of happiness is at your disposal. The only limit to your happiness, then, is how much you can learn to enjoy less.</p>
